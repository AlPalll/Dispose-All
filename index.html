            <p class="p1">Deciding to recycle items is a great first step. However, you also want to make sure that the items are recycled correctly!
               Common types of household recyclables and the best methods to recycle them are shown below.

               Paper
            </h3>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               Paper accounts for 23 percent of municipal solid waste (trash) generated each year, more than any other material. 
               Americans recycled about 68 percent of the paper they used in 2018. This recovered paper is used to make new paper products, saving trees and other natural resources. 
               Most community or office recycling programs accept paper and paper products. Check what your community or office program accepts before you put it in the trash can. 
               When you go shopping, look for products that are made from recycled paper.
            </p>
            <h4 class="type-title"> <strong>Wrap and Gift Bags</strong></h4>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               As the holiday season approaches, Americans will be looking to spread happiness by giving gifts to their families and loved ones. 
               However, every season Americans unknowingly wreak havoc on their local recycling facilities by placing the wrong items in their blue recycling carts.
               If you use gift wrap, look to find a type that can be recycled or that is made from recycled content. A lot of gift wrap isnâ€™t recyclable because of the coating on the paper, which is often shiny and laminated.
               Check with your local recycling provider first to be certain and for the best ways to dispose of wrapping paper. 
               We recommend reusing gift bags and picking up recyclable gift wraps to do your part to keep the earth clean this holiday season.

               Plastics
            </h3>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               More than 35 million tons of plastics were generated in the United States in 2018, which was about 12 percent of the waste stream. 
               Only 8.7 percent of plastics were recycled in 2018. Some types of plastics are recycled much more than others. Most community recycling programs accept some, but not all, types of plastics. 
               Look for products made from recycled plastic materials.

            <p class="type-paragraph">
               <strong>What do the symbols on plastic bottles and containers mean?</strong> These symbols were created by plastic manufacturers to help people identify
               the kind of plastic used to make the container. These symbols can help you determine if the container can be accepted by your local recycling program.
               The type of resin used to make the plastic is designated a number. This number is contained in a triangle that looks very similar to the recycling logo.
               Ask your local recycling center if the type of plastic you have can be recycled at their facility.

               Glass
            </h3>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               Glass, especially glass food and beverage containers, can be recycled over and over again. In the United States in 2018, 12.3 million tons of glass were generated, only 25 percent of which was recovered for recycling. 
               Making new glass from recycled glass is typically cheaper than using raw materials. Most curbside community recycling programs accept different glass colors and types mixed together, and then glass is sorted at the recovery facility. 
               Check with your local program to see if you need to separate your glass or if it can be mixed together.

               Batteries
            </h3>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               One of the most recycled products are lead-acid batteries, with 2.9 million recycled in 2018, representing 99 percent of generation. Although batteries are recyclable, most batteries, including lithium-ion, lithium metal, lead-acid, nickel cadmium, and other rechargeable batteries, should NOT go in household garbage or recycling bins. 
               These waste batteries require special handling and should be taken to specialty drop-off locations or household hazardous waste collection points. Utilize our disposal locations feature to find the nearest appropriate disposal facility.

                  <strong>Dry Cell Batteries</strong> are used in a variety of electronics and include alkaline and carbon zinc (9-volt, D, C, AA, AAA), mercuric-oxide (button, some cylindrical and rectangular), and silver-oxide and zinc-air (button). 
                  Look for in-store recycling bins or community collection events to dispose of these batteries.

                  Do not put them in the trash or municipal recycling bins. Household lithium-ion batteries can be brought to dedicated in-store recycling bins or household hazardous waste collection events for disposal. Medium- and large-scale electric vehicle or energy storage batteries 
                  should be returned to the manufacturer, automobile dealer, or installation company for management at end of life.

                  <strong>Lithium Metal Batteries</strong> are similar to lithium-ion batteries but are not rechargeable. They are commonly used in products such as cameras, watches, remote controls, handheld games, and smoke detectors. Do not put them in the trash or municipal recycling bins:

               Household Hazerdous Waste
            </h3>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               Leftover household products that contain corrosive, toxic, ignitable, or reactive ingredients are considered to be household hazardous waste (HHW). Products such as paints, cleaners, oils, batteries, and pesticides that contain potentially hazardous ingredients require special care when you dispose of them. 
               HHW may be dangerous to people or bad for the environment if poured down the drain, dumped on the ground, or thrown out with regular trash.

                  When the need to dispose of these products arises, look for special collection events in your community or permanent collection centers.

            </h3>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 250px;"> <strong>Oils</strong></h4>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               Never dump your used motor oil down the drain â€” the used oil from one oil change can contaminate one million gallons of fresh water. 
               By recycling your used oil you not only help keep our water supply clean, but help reduce American dependence on foreign oil.
               It takes 42 gallons of crude oil, but only one gallon of used oil, to produce 2.5 quarts of new motor oil. 
               Many garages and auto-supply stores that sell motor oil also accept oil for recycling.

            <h4 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 250px;"> <strong>Tires</strong></h4>
            <p class="type-paragraph">
               Most garages are required to accept and recycle your used tires when you have new ones installed. You may be able to return used tires to either a tire retailer or a local recycling facility that accepts tires. 
               Some communities will hold collection events for used tires.
